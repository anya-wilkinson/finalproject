## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

two ideas: 
1. last year i worked on a molecular biology research project, and i have a lot of sequence data from that. i was thinking of making something where you entered a DNA sequence and it could do some of the analysis for you, which would be really helpful and i would probably use it in the future. current thoughts about pieces of this DNA analysis are sequence length, nucleotide count, GC%, and translation into the amino acid sequence. there is a database from NIH (BLAST) that is publicly accessible and has a downloadale API. if i figured out how to use APIs, i could make the program return the 5 most likely family/genus/species results given by BLAST (my sister offered to show/help me with this, so i would not solely do this for the project). 
2. (backup) something similar to spotify stats, doing music statistics either from spotify or your computer's music system. like file reading and then maybe going through song history, most frequently played songs/artists/albums, etc. or something like the one that makes fun of your music taste because that would be funny.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

n/a plan to work alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

is there a quanitfiable amount for how much work should be done for the project? like a number of hours or something? when i was brainstorming ideas my main concern was whether any of it was "enough" to count for the project.
