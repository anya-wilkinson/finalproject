Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

i have completed the basic analysis function, complementary sequence func, DNA to mRNA func, and I have a working version of the amino acid translation function, as well as an amino acid names to single letter code (slc) func.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

i have to refine the amino acid translator to try and distinguish between the three possible reads of the DNA sequence. since the BLAST/API stuff isn't working i may also add file reading or writing.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

i was going to use the API of an online tool/database from NIH called BLAST to try and analyze the DNA to return a specific organism or genus or soemthing, but once I looked more into it i found that their API is deprecated. they mostly want researchers to connect it to the cloud or just stick to the website, and all of the instructions and examples I found are in other coding languages, but nothing with python or any new version of an API, so it's outside my capabilities.
